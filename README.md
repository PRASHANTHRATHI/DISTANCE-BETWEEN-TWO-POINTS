## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```
import math
x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6

d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)
print(round(d,2))
```
